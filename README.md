# Laplacian Autoencoder (LAE)
Some simple applications the methods proposed in ***Laplacian Autoencoders for Learning Stochastic Representations***

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15078


## Scope of the repository
The idea here is to show the core implementation of the "Laplace Post-Hoc" and "Laplace Online" methods proposed in the paper.

The idea is ***not*** to produce the best model. These notebooks are intentionally kept as simple as possible: no dataloader, no minibatching, no fancy learning rate adjustment. 


## Try it yourself
Note that Stochman is not merged (yet), so you need to clone my repository (in the same folder as this) in oder to have access to the backpropagation functions

```
git clone https://github.com/IlMioFrizzantinoAmabile/stochman;
git clone https://github.com/IlMioFrizzantinoAmabile/Laplacian_Autoencoder;
cd Laplacian_Autoencoder
```
